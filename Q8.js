// Q8. Why do we need Async/Await. Explain a little about how and why we reached here, with relevant examples

//Async await have been recently introduced into JS to make our code look cleaner and make it more maintainable. Async/Await returns a Promise implicitly, we dont need to write Promise keyword.
// Async await only functions only when we put async infront of the function. Await keyword is used inside of async function, 
// we can use Await when calling any function that returns a Promise, including web API functions.
//async await make your program look synchronous. Await pauses the code on  the particular line it is used.
